Pessimists have warned for years about higher inflation, only to have their predictions fall short, he said.<\/p>\n              <p>Risks to the U.S. economy are rife: a potential global slowdown, the risk of spillover from Europe's sovereign debt crisis and the looming raft of tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in at the end of the year unless Congress acts. All could shock the economy and send it back into recession, he said.<\/p>\n              <p>\"We cannot be complacent and assume that the economy is not being damaged if no action is taken,\" Evans said.<\/p>\n              <p>(Reporting by Ann Saphir in Ann Arbor and Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)<\/p>\n            <\/body>\n          <\/html>"

I was scared and tried to reach my car to run away but before I got in the second explosion went off,\" said Habib al-Murshidi who was at the scene.<\/p>\n              <p>\"I saw many people, women and old men lying on the ground which was covered with blood and scattered fruit and vegetables\".<\/p>\n              <p>Another three people were killed by a parked car bomb in Kerbala, 80 km (50 miles) southwest of Baghdad, police said.<\/p>\n              <p>Thousands of Sunni Muslims have taken to the streets since late December in protest at what they see as the marginalization of their sect since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the empowerment of Iraq's Shi'ite majority through the ballot box.<\/p>\n              <p>The demonstrations in the Sunni heartland of Anbar are also compounding fears that war in neighboring Syria, where Sunni rebels are fighting to topple a leader backed by Shi'ite Iran, could further upset Iraq's own delicate sectarian and ethnic balance.<\/p>\n              <p>No group claimed responsibility for the attacks on Friday.<\/p>\n              <p>Iraq is home to several Sunni insurgent groups that have carried out at least one high-casualty attack a month since the U.S. withdrawal. They include a local branch of al Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq, which often targets Shi'ites, seeking to reignite sectarian strife.<\/p>\n              <p>On Monday, a suicide bomber attacked a government-backed militia in Taji, killing at least 22 people -- the seventh of eight suicide bombings in Iraq over the past month alone.<\/p>\n              <p>(Additional reporting by Ali al-Rubaie in Hilla; Writing by Suadad al-Salhy; Editing by Isabel Coles and Jon Hemming)<\/p>\n            <\/body>\n          <\/html>"

Police also used teargas against protesters near the Interior Ministry, a frequent flashpoint for clashes in the Tunisian capital.<\/p>\n              <p>Tunisia, cradle of the Arab uprisings, is riven by tensions between dominant Islamists and their secular opponents, and by frustration at the lack of social and economic progress since President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in January 2011.<\/p>\n              <p>Belaid's assassination has shocked a country which had hitherto experienced a relatively peaceful political transition.<\/p>\n              <p>\"The people want a new revolution,\" shouted mourners in Tunis, who also sang the national anthem.<\/p>\n              <p>Crowds surged around an open army truck carrying Belaid's coffin, draped in a red and white Tunisian flag, from a cultural center in Jebel al-Jaloud towards the leafy Jallaz cemetery, as a security forces helicopter flew overhead.<\/p>\n              <p>\"Belaid, rest in peace, we will continue the struggle,\" mourners chanted, holding portraits of the politician killed near his home on Wednesday by a gunman who fled on a motorcycle.<\/p>\n              <p>Some demonstrators denounced Rachid Ghannouchi, leader of the ruling Islamist Ennahda party. \"Ghannouchi, assassin, criminal,\" they chanted. \"Tunisia is free, terrorism out.\"<\/p>\n              <p>Police fired teargas to disperse anti-government protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs in the southern mining town of Gafsa, a stronghold of support for Belaid, witnesses said.<\/p>\n              <p>Crowds there had chanted \"The people want the fall of the regime\", a slogan first used against Ben Ali.<\/p>\n              <p>CRADLE OF REVOLT<\/p>\n              <p>In Sidi Bouzid, the southern town where the revolt against the ousted strongman began, about 10,000 marched to mourn Belaid and shout slogans against Ennahda and the government.<\/p>\n              <p>Banks, factories and some shops were closed in Tunis and other cities in response to a strike called by unions in protest at Belaid's killing, but buses were running normally.<\/p>\n              <p>Tunis Air suspended all its flights because of the strikes, a spokesman for the national airline said. Airport sources in Cairo said EgyptAir had canceled two flights to Tunisia after staff at Tunis airport joined the general strike.<\/p>\n              <p>After Belaid's assassination, Prime Minister Hamdi Jebali, an Islamist, said he would dissolve the government and form a cabinet of technocrats to rule until elections could be held.<\/p>\n              <p>But his own Ennahda party and its secular coalition partners complained they had not been consulted, casting doubt over the status of the government and compounding political uncertainty.<\/p>\n              <p>No one has claimed responsibility for the killing of Belaid, a lawyer and secular opposition figure.<\/p>\n              <p>His family have blamed Ennahda but the party has denied any hand in the shooting. Crowds have attacked several Ennahda party offices in Tunis and other cities in the past two days.<\/p>\n              <p>\"Hope still exists in Tunisia,\" Fatma Saidan, a noted Tunisian actor, told Reuters at Belaid's funeral. \"We will continue to struggle against extremism and political violence.\"<\/p>\n              <p>She called for national unity, saying: \"We are ready to accept Islamists, but they don't accept us.\"<\/p>\n              <p>SECULAR SYMBOL<\/p>\n              <p>While Belaid had only a modest political following, his criticism of Ennahda policies spoke for many Tunisians who fear religious radicals are bent on snuffing out freedoms won in the first of the revolts that rippled through the Arab world.<\/p>\n              <p>Secular groups have accused the Islamist-led government of a lax response to attacks by ultra-orthodox Salafi Islamists on cinemas, theatres and bars in recent months.<\/p>\n              <p>The economic effect of political uncertainty and street unrest could be serious in a country which has yet to draft a new constitution and which relies heavily on the tourist trade.<\/p>\n              <p>Mohamed Ali Toumi, president of the Tunisian Federation of Travel Agencies, described the week's events as a catastrophe that would have a negative impact on tourism, but he told the national news agency TAP no cancellations had been reported yet.<\/p>\n              <p>France, which had already announced the closure of its schools in Tunis on Friday and Saturday, urged its nationals to stay clear of potential flashpoints in the capital.<\/p>\n              <p>The cost of insuring Tunisian government bonds against default rose to its highest level in more than four years on Thursday and ratings agency Fitch said it could further downgrade Tunisia if political instability continues or worsens.<\/p>\n              <p>(For an interactive look at Tunisia please click on http:\/\/link.reuters.com\/tub85t)<\/p>\n              <p>(Additional reporting by Alexander Dziadosz in Cairo and Brian Love in Paris; Editing by Jon Boyle)<\/p>\n              <p>\ua000\u1958<\/p>\n              <p>\u0736<\/p>\n            <\/body>\n          <\/html>"
